# landing_page

This is my first attempt at creating a dummy webpage from scratch. 

From this, I have learnt to:
- use flexbox
- write html
- and other CSS methods to make the website look less wonky, especially when zooming out.

I would be very glad if you let me know of some mistakes / tips that I should take note of.
